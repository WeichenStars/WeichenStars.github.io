    <h3>Color gradients and z~1 galaxies</h3>
    <br />
    Quite different from their local buddies, z~1 galaxies are known to be considerably obscured by dust. In typical cases, more than 80% of the UV photons from star forming regions are blocked (see Wuyts et al. 2011, ApJ, 742, 96). Therefore in order to figure out where stars are born inside these galaxies, which is one of the most important questions of galaxy formation nowadays, dust extinction effect must be appropriately evaluated (the so-called age-dust degeneracy). <br />
    <br />
    To hack this, I use spatial-resolved deep photometry as obtained by the <a href='https://candels.ucolick.org/' target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">HST CANDELS survey</a> to dissect the colors of z~1 star-forming galaxies (we really count on HST, because most of them are no larger than 1 arc second!). We adapt rest-frame UVJ color diagrams and map color gradients (the colors of galaxies as a function of radius) onto them. Special calibration is designed to infer star formation gradients and dust attenuation gradients based on HST broadband photometry.
    We also look forward to doing this beyond z~1, now hindered by the lack of high resolution mid-IR imaging necessary to derive rest-frame near-IR bands. But that's where <a href='https://jwst.stsci.edu/' target='_blank' style="text-decoration: underline;">JWST</a> is coming to help very soon! 
    <br />
    <br />
    As a byproduct of measuring spatial resolved dust extinction, one can infer essential information about gas distribution and dust geometry of star-forming galaxies. Also, our "broadband photometry based" method can serve the same purpose as a "crude but quick" (and flexible, effective!) way to analyse galaxy properties in the next age of large data, as boosted by several upcoming gigantic photometry surveys (e.g. <a href='http://pfs.ipmu.jp' target='_blank' style="text-decoration: underline;">PFS</a> and <a href='https://www.lsst.org' target='_blank' style="text-decoration: underline;">LSST</a>).

    <h3>Dust attenuation law and galaxy inclination</h3>
    <br />
    <em>This is a work in progress</em>. To be updated. 
    <!--Galaxies acquire the bulk of their mass before z>1 (e.g. Conroy and Wechsler ApJ 696, 620). But whether the build-up mainly happens during stochastic star-formation bursts or relatively smooth continuous star formation remains poorly constrained. We are currently exploring observational traits using multiple star-formation tracers (IR, UV, emission lines) as predicted by the hydro-dynamical simulations such as FIRE (Hopkins et al. 2017).
