## Galactic winds beyond the local universe

This work is in progress.

## "Slitlet-Stepping": a novel mode of spatially-resolved spectroscopic observations with JWST

I have been involved in a technical study to develop a novel observation mode for the JWST NIRSpec instrument. The mode, named ''slitlet stepping'', will enable spatially resolved spectroscopic observations of at least 30 galaxies simultaneously, by making use of the Mirco-Shutter Assembly on the NIRSpec. The mode is at least 10 times as efficient as the NIRSpec IFU mode which only targets at one galaxy at a single time. The high efficiency will open up great opportunities for large galaxy surveys with JWST, which has just 5 years of designed mission time. 

I am currently leading an effort to implement this mode to the upcoming observations of [our approved JWST program](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information.html?id=2123){:target="_blank"} (P.I.: Susan Kassin), one of the largest General Observers programs in Cycle 1 for galaxy science. This technical project is developed solely upon the tools and documentations related to JWST that are public, and all the tools we develop from the project will be made publicly available during Cycle 1. 

## The IRX-beta relation and dust distribution for galaxies at z&sim;1

Accurate measurements of the galaxy star formation rates are essential for us to understand how galaxies form from observations. However, a significant fraction of the star formation can be obscured by dust. The obscured star formation needs to be inferred indirectly by assuming a certain dust attenuation law if no far-infrared photometry is available, which is often the case for galaxies at high redshifts. In Wang et al. (2018), we find that the dust attenuation law is dependent on the galaxy inclination, which can lead to systematic errors up to 0.3 dex in the inferred star formation rates. By introducing an inclination correction, our study brings more accurate measurements of star formation rates at $z\sim 1$ and above.  

Details about this study can be found from [my talk at the STScI/JHU Galaxy Journal Club](http://WeichenStars.github.io/files/GJC_WWang.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

## The radial distribution of star formation and dust for galaxies at z&sim;1
<!---
Quite different from their local buddies, z&sim;1 galaxies are known to be considerably obscured by dust. In typical cases,more than 80% of the UV photons from star forming regions are blocked (see Wuyts et al. 2011, ApJ, 742, 96). Therefore in order to figure out where stars are born inside these galaxies, which is one of the most important questions of galaxy formation nowadays, dust extinction effect must be appropriately evaluated.

To hack this, I use spatial-resolved deep photometry as obtained by the [HST CANDELS](https://candels.ucolick.org/){:target="_blank"} to dissect the colors of z&sim;1 star-forming galaxies (we really count on HST, because most of them are no larger than 1 arc second!). We adapt rest-frame UVJ color diagrams and map color gradients (the colors of galaxies as a function of radius) onto them. Special calibration is designed to infer star formation gradients and dust attenuation gradients based on HST broadband photometry. We also look forward to doing this beyond z&sim;1, now hindered by the lack of high resolution mid-IR imaging necessary to derive rest-frame near-IR bands. But that's where [JWST](https://jwst.stsci.edu/){:target="_blank"} is coming to help hopefully soon.
