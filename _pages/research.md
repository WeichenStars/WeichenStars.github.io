## 1. Galactic winds beyond the local universe

Galactic winds are the outflowing gas ejected from galaxies, and they are considered to have a prominent impact on galaxy formation. However, much is to be known about the origin and detaild properties of winds, especially in the early Universe. 

My PhD research on galactic winds is motivated by a science question: how and where the winds are occur within galaxies. I intend to answer the questions using the observation data from a Keck spectroscopic survey program HALO7D (PI: R. Guhathakurta, UC Santa Cruz), which includes around 200 star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 1$ with deep exposures on the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS). 

> I led a case study of the cool phase of galactic winds from a massive star-forming galaxy at $z \sim 1$ (Wang et al. 2021). Our study indicates that the winds are most likely launched from a spatially extended area which includes both the inner and outer regions of the galaxy. We also find that the spatially extended star formation inside the galaxy is the most probable driver of the observed extended winds. 

> It might be common for the massive star-forming galaxies at this cosmic epoch to have winds launched from the entire galaxies. This is supported by a separate study, in which we find that spatially extended star formation is common among massive star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 1$ (Wang et al. 2017). Studying where the winds are launched for a larger sample of galaxies in the future will help us better understand where the stellar feedback is directly “in action” and what roles galactic winds play in the formation of bulges, disks, and metallicity gradients of distant galaxies.


## 2. "Slitlet-Stepping": a novel mode of spatially-resolved spectroscopic observations with JWST

I have been involved in a study to develop a novel observation mode for the JWST NIRSpec instrument. The mode, named 'Slitlet-Stepping'', will enable spatially resolved spectroscopic observations of at least 30 galaxies simultaneously, by making use of the Mirco-Shutter Assembly on the NIRSpec. The mode is at least 10 times as efficient as the NIRSpec IFU mode which only targets at one galaxy at a single time. The high efficiency will open up great opportunities for large galaxy surveys with JWST. 

I am currently leading an effort to implement this mode to the upcoming observations of [our approved JWST program](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information.html?id=2123){:target="_blank"} (PI: Susan Kassin), one of the largest General Observers programs in Cycle 1 for galaxy science. The project is developed solely upon the tools and documentations that are public, and all the tools we develop from the project will be made publicly available during Cycle 1. 

## 3. The dust attenuation law for galaxies at $z\sim 1$

Accurate measurements of the galaxy star formation rates are essential for us to understand how galaxies form. However, a significant fraction of the star formation can be obscured by dust. The obscured star formation needs to be inferred indirectly by assuming a certain dust attenuation law if no far-infrared photometry is available, which is often the case for galaxies at high redshifts. 

> In Wang et al. (2018), we find that the dust attenuation law is dependent on the galaxy inclination, which can lead to systematic errors up to 0.3 dex in the inferred star formation rates. By introducing an inclination correction, our study brings more accurate measurements of star formation rates at $z\sim 1$ and above.  Details about this study can be found from [my talk at the STScI/JHU Galaxy Journal Club](http://WeichenStars.github.io/files/GJC_WWang.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
