## Galactic winds beyond the local universe

> My Ph.D research on galactic winds is motivated by a specific science question: how and where galactic winds are launched and affect the star formation inside star-forming galaxies in the early Universe. The research is mainly based on the observation data from a Keck spectroscopic survey program HALO7D (PI: R. Guhathakurta, UC Santa Cruz), which includes around 200 star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 1$ with deep exposures on the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph. 

> I led a case study of the winds from a massive star-forming galaxy at $z \sim 1$ from HALO7D (Wang et al. 2021).  We use the Mg II and Fe II lines in the rest-frame ultraviolet as tracers of the cool outflowing gas. Our study indicates that the winds are most likely launched from a spatially extended area which includes both the inner and outer regions of the galaxy. The spatially extended star formation inside the galaxy is the most probable drive of the observed extended winds. 

In a separate study, we find that spatially extended star formation is common among massive star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 1$ (Wang et al. 2017).  Therefore, it might be common for the massive star-forming galaxies at this cosmic epoch to have winds launched from across the entire galaxies. Meausuring where winds are launched for a larger galaxy sample will help us better understand where the stellar feedback is directly “in action” and what roles galactic winds play in the formation of bulges, disks, and metallicity gradients of distant galaxies.

> Besides the study of massive galaxies, I am currently leading another effort to measure the cool winds from low-mass galaxies at $z \sim 1$. Relevant detailed will be updated soon.


## "Slitlet-Stepping": a novel mode of spatially-resolved spectroscopic observations with JWST

> I have been involved in a technical study to develop a novel observation mode for the JWST NIRSpec instrument. The mode, named 'slitlet stepping'', will enable spatially resolved spectroscopic observations of at least 30 galaxies simultaneously, by making use of the Mirco-Shutter Assembly on the NIRSpec. The mode is at least 10 times as efficient as the NIRSpec IFU mode which only targets at one galaxy at a single time. The high efficiency will open up great opportunities for large galaxy surveys with JWST. 

> I am currently leading an effort to implement this mode to the upcoming observations of [our approved JWST program](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information.html?id=2123){:target="_blank"} (P.I.: Susan Kassin), one of the largest General Observers programs in Cycle 1 for galaxy science. This technical project is developed solely upon the tools and documentations related to JWST that are public, and all the tools we develop from the project will be made publicly available during Cycle 1. 

## The dust attenuation law for galaxies at z&sim;1

> Accurate measurements of the galaxy star formation rates are essential for us to understand how galaxies form. However, a significant fraction of the star formation can be obscured by dust. The obscured star formation needs to be inferred indirectly by assuming a certain dust attenuation law if no far-infrared photometry is available, which is often the case for galaxies at high redshifts. 

> In Wang et al. (2018), we find that the dust attenuation law is dependent on the galaxy inclination, which can lead to systematic errors up to 0.3 dex in the inferred star formation rates. By introducing an inclination correction, our study brings more accurate measurements of star formation rates at $z\sim 1$ and above.  Details about this study can be found from [my talk at the STScI/JHU Galaxy Journal Club](http://WeichenStars.github.io/files/GJC_WWang.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
