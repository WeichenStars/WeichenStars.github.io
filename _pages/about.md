I am currently a postdoc research at the [University of Milano-Bicocca](https://astro.fisica.unimib.it/){:target="_blank"}. My research is focused on characterizing the formation of high-redshift galaxies in special cosmic environments and detecting the diffuse cosmic gas called CGM/IGM, both of which will provide us essential pieces to solve a critical puzzle of modern astronomy: **what roles has the large-scale environment played in galaxy formation.** 

My research has been built upon observations with several major telescopes, including the JWST, VLT/MUSE and Keck/DEIMOS.  The JWST programs I am heavily involved in can be found [here](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information.html?id=1835){:target="_blank"} and [here](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information.html?id=2123){:target="_blank"}. I work closely with [Prof. Sebastiano Cantalupo](http://cosmib.org/cantalupo/index.html){:target="_blank"} and many other colleagues in the [COSMIB group](http://cosmib.org/){:target="_blank"} at Milan and around the world.

I defended my Ph.D. at the [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/){:target="_blank"} in 2022. For my thesis, I studied the outflowing gas from galaxies (a.k.a. galactic winds) in the distant Universe. I worked with [Dr. Susan Kassin](http://www.susankassin.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Tim Heckman](https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/directory/timothy-heckman/){:target="_blank"}. I also collaborated with [Prof. Sandy Faber](http://www.ucolick.org/~faber/){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. David Koo](http://www.ucolick.org/~board/faculty/koo.html){:target="_blank"} at University of California, Santa Cruz. Before going to Baltimore, I spent my college life at Tsinghua University in Beijing, where I worked at [Tsinghua Center for Astrophysics](http://astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} with [Prof. Shude Mao](http://astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/~smao/){:target="_blank"} on gravitational lensing (Find a roasted duck [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/08/rubber-duck-beijing_n_3889252.html){:target="_blank"}).
