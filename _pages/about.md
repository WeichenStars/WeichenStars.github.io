I am a finishing astronomy Ph.D. student at the [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My research has been focused on the distribution of several baryonic components that constitute distant galaxies, including new-born stars, dust, and gas. 

For my thesis, I study the cool gas outflows (a.k.a. winds) from galaxies in the early Universe. I aim to understanding where the outflows are launched inside galaxies and how they affect galaxy formation in general. The data I use come from the Keck telescope in Hawaii (HALO7D), the Hubble Space Telescope (CANDELS), and, in the near future, the James Webb Space Telescope (see [our cycle-1 proposal](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information.html?id=2123){:target="_blank"}).

I work with [Dr. Susan Kassin](http://www.susankassin.com/){:target="_blank"} at the [Space Telescope Science Institute](http://www.stsci.edu){:target="_blank"}. I also keep collaboration with [Prof. Sandy Faber](http://www.ucolick.org/~faber/){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. David Koo](http://www.ucolick.org/~board/faculty/koo.html){:target="_blank"} at [University of California, Santa Cruz](http://www.astro.ucsc.edu/){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Tim Heckman](https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/directory/timothy-heckman/){:target="_blank"} here at Hopkins. Before coming to Baltimore, I spent my college life at [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/newthuen/){:target="_blank"} in Beijing, where I worked at [Tsinghua Center for Astrophysics](http://astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} with [Prof. Shude Mao](http://astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/~smao/){:target="_blank"} on gravitational lensing (Find a roasted duck [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/08/rubber-duck-beijing_n_3889252.html){:target="_blank"}).
