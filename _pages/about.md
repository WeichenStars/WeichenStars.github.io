I am a fifth year PhD student in [astronomy and astrophysics](http://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/){:target="_blank"}  at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My current research focuses on understanding the spatial distribution of multiple physical components that constitute distant galaxies (new-born stars, dust, gas, and dark matter). The observational data I use come from large extragalactic surveys that are conducted on the Hubble Space Telescope (CANDELS, 3D-HST, etc) and the Keck Telescope.

I work with [Dr. Susan Kassin](http://www.susankassin.com/){:target="_blank"} at [Space Telescope Science Institute](http://www.stsci.edu){:target="_blank"}. I also keep collaboration with [Prof. Sandy Faber](http://www.ucolick.org/~faber/){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. David Koo](http://www.ucolick.org/~board/faculty/koo.html){:target="_blank"} at [University of California, Santa Cruz](http://www.astro.ucsc.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

Before coming to Baltimore, I spent my college life at [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/newthuen/){:target="_blank"}, where I worked at [Tsinghua Center for Astrophysics](http://astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} with [Prof. Shude Mao](http://astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/~smao/){:target="_blank"} on gravitational lensing in Beijing (Find a roasted duck [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/08/rubber-duck-beijing_n_3889252.html){:target="_blank"}).
