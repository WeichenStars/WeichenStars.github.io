I am a third year PhD student in [astronomy and astrophysics](http://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/)  at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). My current research involves understanding galaxy formation, dust geometry and star formation features using large extragalactic surveys conducted on the Hubble Space Telescope (CANDELS, 3D-HST, etc).

I work with [Dr. Susan Kassin](http://www.susankassin.com/) at [Space Telescope Science Institute](http://www.stsci.edu). I also keep collaboration with [Prof. Sandy Faber](http://www.ucolick.org/~faber/) at [University of California, Santa Cruz](http://www.astro.ucsc.edu/).

Before coming to Baltimore, I spent my college life at [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/newthuen/), where I worked at [Tsinghua Center for Astrophysics](http://astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/) with [Prof. Shude Mao](http://astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/~smao/) on gravitational lensing in Beijing (Find a roasted duck [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/08/rubber-duck-beijing_n_3889252.html)).
