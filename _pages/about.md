I am currently a postdoc researcher at the [University of Milano-Bicocca](https://astro.fisica.unimib.it/){:target="_blank"}. My research is focused on detecting the ambient cosmic gas around and away from galaxies in the distant Universe and characterizing the roles of such cosmic gas in the formation of galaxies. I use several major telescopes across the world for my research, the most noticeable among which are the VLT and JWST (see the JWST cycle-1 programs I am heavily involved in [here](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information.html?id=1835){:target="_blank"} and [here](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information.html?id=2123){:target="_blank"}). I work closely with [Prof. Sebastiano Cantalupo](http://cosmib.org/cantalupo/index.html){:target="_blank"} and other members of the [COSMIB group](http://cosmib.org/){:target="_blank"} in Milan.

I defended my Ph.D. thesis at the Johns Hopkins University in 2022. For my thesis, I studied the cool outflowing gas (a.k.a. winds) from galaxies in the distant Universe. I worked with [Dr. Susan Kassin](http://www.susankassin.com/){:target="_blank"} at the [Space Telescope Science Institute](http://www.stsci.edu){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Tim Heckman](https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/directory/timothy-heckman/){:target="_blank"} at Hopkins. I also collaborated with [Prof. Sandy Faber](http://www.ucolick.org/~faber/){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. David Koo](http://www.ucolick.org/~board/faculty/koo.html){:target="_blank"} at University of California, Santa Cruz. Before going to Baltimore, I spent my college life at [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/newthuen/){:target="_blank"} in Beijing, where I worked at [Tsinghua Center for Astrophysics](http://astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} with [Prof. Shude Mao](http://astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/~smao/){:target="_blank"} on gravitational lensing (Find a roasted duck [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/08/rubber-duck-beijing_n_3889252.html){:target="_blank"}).
