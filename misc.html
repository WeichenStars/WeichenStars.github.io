  <h3>Where was I?</h3>
  I was born in a small and peaceful town in the northeastern part of China (find over <a href='https://www.google.com/maps/place/Baishan,+Jilin,+China/@41.9393869,126.3558604,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x5e338277db99c7e1:0xc7e6e02414566b7a!8m2!3d41.940977!4d126.424251' target='_blank' style="text-decoration: underline;">google map</a>). I had the fortune of getting in touch with astronomy at the age of 13, triggered by a simple 2.4 inch refractive telescope from my paremts as my birthday gift (let me add my "masterpiece" from that telescope soon). The decision to be a professional astronomer is made after finding myself also enjoy physics research much later in my teenage years. I spent my four-year's college life at Tsinghua University, named after a royal garden located at the campus site in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">Tsing (or Qing) Dynasty</a>.

  <h3>Why astronomer?</h3>
  Those I took the liberty to learn from within and beyond academics in the college, as well as great astronomers I have the luck to be taught by (YES, that is another of my great fortune!), lead me to go into acdemics. When letting loose my mind from codes and data, I'm always fascinated by the etemity and openess of the universe: it is always there!

  <h3>More</h3>
  My favorite intellectuals are <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus' target='_blank' style="text-decoration: underline;">Albert Camus</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuang_Zhou' target='_blank' style="text-decoration: underline;">Zhuang Zhou</a>. And the astronomer I admired most is <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Rubin'  target='_blank' style="text-decoration: underline;">Dr. Vera Rubin</a>.
